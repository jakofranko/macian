1. The borders classes have a lot of issues that prevent them from being intuitive:
    1. `br` is the `border-right-style/width` class, but that is also the prefix for the `border-radius` classes. This should be differentiated a bit.
    2. The zero-width classes break all the conventions; I would expect `btw0`, `bbw0` etc., but instead they are `bt-0`.
    3. Lots of the class categories lack responsive versions, notably the border-style classes, and the zero-border classes.
2. The height and width classes also have a lot of inconsistencies that make them difficult to intuit:
    1. The classes that use the `em` unit are prefixed with `s` for some reason e.g., `sh1`. Presumably this is "screen-height 1"? I'd like to come up with a different convention `em` unit classes.
    2. The min-height classes are prefixed with `n`. This should probably be `mnh` ?
    3. the max-height classes are prefixed with `x`. This hsould probably be `mxh` ?
    4. The `em` unit classes only go up to 7??
    5. the min-width class prefix is `mw`, but the min-height prefix is `nh` ?????
3. Add flex classes
4. Add margin 0 auto class (or just margin-side: auto classes)
5. Add additional top/bottom classes through to f
6. Differentiate out the grid system from css grids
7. Box shadows can be set on the 'horizontal' sides via `bslr` or 'vertical' sides via `bstb`, but the margin and padding classes do this via `mv*` or `mh*` (for 'vertical' and 'horizontal'). Need to standardize.
8. Convert colors and perhaps other reused values into variables.
9. Some classes append `a` to the name to designate 'all sides', like `ba` for "border all sides", or `bsia` for "box shadow inset all sides". However, other classes imply all sides, like `m4` or `p4`, which apply margins or padding to all sides. We should standardize on this.
